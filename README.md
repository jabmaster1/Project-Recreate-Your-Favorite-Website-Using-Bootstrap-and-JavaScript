I created a very simplified rendition of Wikipedia. I opted to keep this a full boostrap styled page so did not include a css document.

Project Requirements:

Part 1:

1. Navigation Bar:
-added bootstrap styled navigation bar with multiple links
-Navbar is responsive across all screen sizes

2. Home Page:
-Home page was designed to keep the offensively bright style of wikipedia
-Headings, wiki logo and card containing the hero section was added

3. Form Section:
-input form was created
-added an email and textarea input with the required conditions and a submit button

4. Table:
-table was created and styled with bootstrap
-relevant information added to table

5. 3 Bootstrap Components:
-Opted to try and add the card, carousel and accordian components.
-All seem to integrate fine and are responsive. all styled with bootstrap.

Part 2:

1. Write 4-5 JavaScript Functions:
-Added 4 functions that would seem relevant to Wikipedia

2. Submit the JavaScript File Seperately:
-Functions designed to be applicable to the website
-Comments added to functions to explain rationale
